# AI-code-box
This project uses OpenAI's Codex API to develop an AI-driven code companion that supports developers with a range of programming tasks. It includes features like inserting comments, improving variable names for clarity, proposing descriptive function names, addressing common bugs, and facilitating code translation between different languages (e.g., from C++ to Python).
